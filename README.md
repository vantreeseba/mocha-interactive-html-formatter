Very early release... this will probably break.

The idea is that this spits out an interactive html output similar to
how cucumber does with test suites.

Currently it creates a mocha dir below the CWD, and puts an index.html
there.  This is hardcoded as I didn't know how to pass the dir as an
option into the mocha formatter.

If this project is silly, or you have suggestions, let me know.
